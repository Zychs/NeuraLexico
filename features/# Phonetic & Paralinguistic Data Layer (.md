# Phonetic & Paralinguistic Data Layer (Exploratory)

**Status:** concept stage  
**Purpose:** maintain the ability to ingest and analyze sub-phonemic vocal data
without deciding on feature representation or model architecture.

### Why
To ensure Neuralexica can evolve toward affective and cognitive signal analysis
without re-architecting the ingest pipeline.

### Current Focus
- Collect reference material on openSMILE / torchaudio / Praat.
- Log potential feature types (plosives, fricatives, breaths, clicks).
- Note data-privacy and storage implications.

### Next Steps
1. Draft event schema proposal.
2. Prototype 30-sec audio feature extraction test.
3. Evaluate storage footprint + latency.

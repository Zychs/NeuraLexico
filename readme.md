# NeuraLexico

NeuraLexico is the core codebase for a **semantic-first cognitive tooling system** powering  
Addvar-style voice-driven journaling, memory tagging, and symbolic execution pipelines.

### 📦 Repository Structure
📁 core → future primary code (memory engine, pipelines, etc.)
📁 interface → voice interface modules (Whisper, intent routing, audio buffer, etc.)
📁 docs → diagrams & architecture references
📁 legacy → archived Java prototypes (journal CLI, voice recognizer)
📁 pytils → small Python utilities & prototypes
📁 schema → JSON schemas for ledger + doctrine models

---

### ✅ Current Progress

- [x] Repo initialized + folder architecture defined
- [x] Legacy Java CLI archived under `/legacy`
- [x] Voice interface scaffold added (`whisper-pipeline.py`, etc.)
- [x] Reference diagrams imported to `/docs`
- [ ] Establish Core Addvar memory engine (in progress)
- [ ] Establish Phonetic & Paralinguistic Data Accessibility
- [ ] Ledger + semantic tagging pipeline (next milestone)

### 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo will eventually contain:

- The **Addvar memory engine**
- Semantic labeling + journaling pipelines
- CLI interface & invocation protocols
- Future integrations (Porcupine, Faster-Whisper, Ollama, Piper-TTS, FAISS, etc.)

### ▶️ Running (Prototype Only)

Python utilities live in `/pytils` and can be executed directly:

```sh
python pytils/directoroot.py

Voice interface scaffolding lives under:

/interface/voice/scaffold/
